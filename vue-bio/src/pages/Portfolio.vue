          <span class="font-bold">CrushingTravel.com</span> is a faux travel
          blog created as part of a personal project to enhance my WordPress and
          Elementor skills. The site features an engaging travel-inspired
          layout, designed with the flexibility of the Elementor theme. While
          the content is fictional, it demonstrates a clean, user-friendly
          design and showcases my ability to develop with WordPress. This
          project highlights my growth in web development, particularly in
          customizing WordPress sites with the Elementor page builder for a
          professional, responsive experience.

          <span class="font-bold">Draggable List Component</span> is a
          custom-built feature developed using React and Next.js, aimed at
          enhancing my understanding of Next.js and deepening my knowledge of
          React. This interactive component allows users to reorder items
          dynamically through drag-and-drop functionality. The project helped me
          explore advanced React concepts such as state management, event
          handling, and component composition, while also giving me hands-on
          experience with Next.js for building optimized, server-side rendered
          applications.
